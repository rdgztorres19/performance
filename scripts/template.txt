Title
[Clear, opinionated performance principle or trade-off]

Subtitle
Short explanation of why this performance topic matters in real systems.

Executive Summary (TL;DR)
Brief summary (3–5 sentences) explaining the core performance idea, when it applies, and the main benefits and trade-offs.

Problem Context
Describe the real-world performance problem. Explain common misconceptions, typical scaling mistakes, and why naive solutions fail in production.

How It Works
Explain the underlying technical mechanics. Cover hardware, OS, runtime behavior, execution models, bottlenecks, and key concepts like latency, throughput, IPC, contention, cache, and scheduling.

Why This Becomes a Bottleneck
Explain why performance degrades when this principle is ignored. Include serialization points, synchronization overhead, resource contention, scaling limits, and latency amplification.

Advantages
List clear and measurable benefits such as reduced latency, improved throughput, better predictability, lower overhead, or simpler architecture. Quantify improvements when possible.

Disadvantages and Trade-offs
List real limitations and costs. Explain where this approach breaks down, including scalability limits, hardware cost, complexity, or worse performance in certain workloads.

When to Use This Approach
Describe specific conditions where this approach is recommended. Include workload characteristics, system constraints, architecture patterns, and latency versus throughput requirements.

When Not to Use It
Explicitly describe scenarios where this approach is a bad fit or causes worse performance.

Performance Impact
Describe expected impact using real-world observations or benchmarks. Include effects on latency percentiles, throughput, and resource utilization.

Common Mistakes
List frequent errors engineers make related to this topic, such as over-parallelization, blind hardware scaling, ignoring profiling data, or optimizing the wrong layer.

How to Measure and Validate
Explain how to validate improvements. Include metrics to track, profiling tools, benchmarking strategies, load testing, and production verification.

Summary and Key Takeaways
Restate the core principle, highlight the main trade-off, and provide a clear decision guideline.
