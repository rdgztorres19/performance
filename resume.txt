Prefer Fewer Fast CPU Cores Over Many Slow Ones for Latency-Sensitive Workloads
A common misconception in performance optimization is that more CPU cores always translate to better performance.
Cache Hierarchy: Fast cores typically feature larger, faster L1 and L2 caches per core
They also have better prefetching logic that predicts memory access patterns.

Sequential Bottlenecks (Amdahl's Law)
Every parallel algorithm has sequential portions that cannot be parallelized
The sequential portion becomes the bottleneck.

Context Switching Overhead
When a thread is paused, the OS must save registers, stack, and CPU state.
Fewer instructions per second
Context switches take longer in real time
With many threads, context switching overhead dominates

Lock / Mutex Contention
Shared resources require locks. Only one thread can enter the critical section at a time.
Hold locks longer (execute critical section code slowly)
Thread queues grow quickly
Fast cores: Enter, execute, and release locks quickly, Less waiting time for other threads

Cache Misses (Critical Factor)
Context switching evicts cache lines
Other threads overwrite cache
Execute fewer instructions before being preempted, Lose cache more often (context switches evict cache lines)
Cache misses dominate execution time (each miss costs 100-300ns)

Blocking I/O (Network, Disk, DB)
Many applications are I/O-bound, not CPU-bound. Threads wait for external resources (network responses, disk reads, database queries).
Process I/O results slowly when data arrives
Hold buffers and locks longer while processing

Common Mistakes
Assuming More Cores Always Help: Adding cores to applications with sequential bottlenecks without profiling to identify the actual bottleneck
Over-Parallelization: Creating excessive threads that contend for fast cores, leading to context switching overhead that negates single-thread advantages
Mismatched Architecture Patterns: Using request-per-thread models (many threads) with fast-core architectures instead of event-driven or async models
Cache-Unaware Algorithms: Implementing algorithms that ignore cache locality, wasting the cache advantages of fast cores

---------------------------------------
Reduce Context Switching
A common misconception is that increasing the number of threads automatically improves performance
Slower execution means threads stay active longer.
Blocking behavior worsens the situation. Threads that wait for I/O or locks stop and later resume. Each stop and resume adds more switching and more coordination work.
Longer Uninterrupted Execution Means Less Rework ()

Fragmented work often requires:
Re-checking conditions
Re-entering code paths
Re-establishing execution flow

When execution switches to another thread, different data is accessed and the previous data becomes less immediately available.
When the original thread resumes, accessing its data again takes longer than if it had continued running.

Less Time Spent Coordinating, More Time Doing Work
Context switches often interrupt threads that are actively making progress. These interruptions break the natural flow of execution and reduce efficiency.
When threads are interrupted frequently, tasks take longer to complete because they are repeatedly paused and resumed.

A time quantum (also called time slice) is the amount of CPU time a runnable thread is allowed to execute
Its effective length varies depending on:
-The operating system scheduler implementation
-The scheduling policy in use
-The number of runnable threads in the run queue
-Thread priorities
-Overall system load

What Causes a Thread to Context Switch
1. Time Quantum Expiration (Preemption)
2. Blocking Operations (Voluntary Switching)
3. Lock Contention (When a thread attempts to acquire a lock that is already held:)
4. Higher-Priority Threads Becoming Runnable
5. Thread Migration Between CPU Cores

How to Reduce Context Switching
Use Thread Pools Instead of Creating Threads
Limit Concurrency to CPU Cores for CPU-Bound Work (If there are more CPU-bound threads than CPU cores, the operating system must constantly rotate between them, interrupting each one even while it is making progress.)
Use Async / Non-Blocking I/O Instead of Blocking I/O (With blocking I/O, a thread starts an operation (like a network or disk call) and then stops doing anything while waiting for the result. That thread must later be restarted when the operation completes, causing additional context switches.
-With async I/O, the thread starts the operation and immediately returns. The operating system notifies the application later when the I/O is complete, without stopping a thread just to wait.
Minimize Lock Contention 
-When multiple threads need the same lock, some threads must wait. Waiting threads stop running and later resume when the lock becomes available. Each wait and resume introduces context switches.
Reduce Thread Migration Between CPU Cores
Avoid sleep, yield, and Busy Waiting

-----------------
Threads Affinity
the operating system is free to move threads between cores to balance load
While this is usually beneficial, it can hurt performance for latency-sensitive or cache-sensitive workloads.
Modern operating systems use schedulers designed to keep all CPU cores busy. To achieve this, they dynamically move processes and threads between cores to balance load
By default, operating systems do not strictly bind threads to specific CPU cores.

Instead, the scheduler uses a soft affinity strategy:
-It prefers to run a thread on the same core it ran on last
-But it is free to move the thread whenever it decides it is beneficial

Why Threads Are Migrated
To prevent some cores from being overloaded while others are idle
To ensure all runnable threads get CPU time
To spread heat and optimize energy usage

Why Thread Affinity Improves Performance
1. Preserving CPU Cache Locality

When a thread migrates to another core:
-Its data is no longer in the local cache
-The new core must fetch data again
-Execution stalls while data is reloaded

2. Fewer Cache Misses Means Fewer CPU Stalls
Cache misses force the CPU to wait for data. These waits add latency even if no context switch occurs.

4. Reduced Context Switching Pressure
Although affinity does not eliminate context switching, it reduces unnecessary switches caused by migration and rebalancing.
